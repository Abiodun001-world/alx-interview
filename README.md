# ALX-Interview Project - Pascal's Triangle

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on implementing Pascal's Triangle algorithm in Python. The goal is to familiarize yourself with technical interview concepts and practice problem-solving skills.

## Concepts

The main concept to focus on for this project is **Technical Interview**. You will have an opportunity to practice technical interview skills by implementing Pascal's Triangle algorithm in Python.

## About the Author

This project was created by Alexa Orrico, a Software Engineer at Holberton School. 

## Algorithm

The Pascal's Triangle algorithm is a mathematical concept that generates a triangular array of binomial coefficients. It starts with a row containing a single value of 1, and each subsequent row is constructed by adding the adjacent values from the previous row. The resulting triangle has various applications in mathematics and computer science.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository from the provided URL.
2. Familiarize yourself with the project structure and files.
3. Implement the Pascal's Triangle algorithm in Python according to the given requirements.
4. Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure correctness.
5. Submit your solution before the deadline for the automated review.

## Requirements

Your implementation of Pascal's Triangle should meet the following requirements:

- The function should be named `pascal_triangle`.
- It should take an integer `n` as input.
- The function should return a list of lists representing the Pascal's Triangle up to the `n`th row.
- Each inner list should contain the values of a row in the triangle.
- The triangle should be constructed using the Pascal's Triangle algorithm.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the `pascal_triangle` function:

```python
>>> pascal_triangle(5)
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
```

This example generates the first five rows of Pascal's Triangle.

## Testing

It is important to test your implementation to ensure it works correctly. You can create additional test cases to verify the accuracy of your solution.

## Good luck!

I Take this opportunity to practice my technical interview skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms. Feel free to reach out for help if you encounter any issues during the project. Good luck, and enjoy the learning process!
