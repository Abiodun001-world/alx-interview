# Lockboxes

This is the README file for the "Lockboxes" project. The purpose of this project is to implement an algorithm in Python that solves a lockbox puzzle. The project is part of an ongoing second chance opportunity and is being developed by Carrie Ybay, a Software Engineer at Holberton School.


## Requirements

### General

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/Compiled on: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should be properly documented
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style guidelines (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Usage

To use the lockbox algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Open your preferred editor (vi, vim, emacs) and locate the file containing the lockbox algorithm implementation.
4. Ensure that the Python version 3.4.3 is installed on your system.
5. Execute the script by running the file with the Python interpreter. For example:
   ```
   $ python3 lockbox_algorithm.py
   ```
6. Follow the instructions provided by the program to interact with the lockbox puzzle.

## Documentation

The lockbox algorithm implementation is documented within the code files. Please refer to the inline comments and docstrings for detailed explanations of the functionality and usage of specific functions and methods.

## Style Guidelines

The code follows the PEP 8 style guidelines (version 1.7.x) to ensure consistency and readability. Please adhere to these guidelines when modifying or extending the codebase.
